# iSamples Export Service

The iSamples export service export iSamples records that match [solr queries](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/query-guide/query-syntax-and-parsers.html).  Only users that have been authenticated using [orcid](https://orcid.org) are allowed to access the export services.  Additionally, users have to be granted access using the iSamples admin API in order to export results.

## Creating an export job
The first step in the export process is to create an export job.  An example workflow follows:

```
isamples_inabox % curl  "http://localhost:8000/export/create?q=source:SMITHSONIAN&export_format=jsonl"
{"status":"created","uuid":"0d64cf54-24a3-410f-9da3-ef961e78821e"}
```

The response contains the uuid you will use to refer to the job while it is running and after it is completed.

## Checking the export job status
While the solr export is working, you may query the status of the job as follows:

```
isamples_inabox % curl  "http://localhost:8000/export/status?uuid=0d64cf54-24a3-410f-9da3-ef961e78821e"
{"status":"started","tstarted":"2024-03-15 06:21:48.227189"}
``` 
In this instance, we can see the export has started but isn't yet complete.  If we check back later, we can see the job is done:

```
isamples_inabox % curl  "http://localhost:8000/export/status?uuid=0d64cf54-24a3-410f-9da3-ef961e78821e"
{"status":"completed","tcompleted":"2024-03-15 06:24:37.488125"}
```

## Downloading the result
Once we see that the job has a "completed" status, we can download the result like so:

```
isamples_inabox % curl "http://localhost:8000/export/download?uuid=0d64cf54-24a3-410f-9da3-ef961e78821e"

and we can see the contents of the file echoed to the command line by curl.
